# Golang Tracing Workshop

Code for my DASH 2019 Golang Distributed Tracing Workshop

## Outline

### Why Instrument an Application with Traces?

Begin by spinning up a microservices application (GCP's [Microservices Demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)), and seeing how an instrumented application within Datadog gives us insight into architecture, bottlnecks, etc.

See the Service Map, watch traffic along with Distributed Traces.

## Instrumenting with OpenCensus, OpenTelemetry, or OpenTracing

Quickly showcase how to drop in a Datadog exporter for OpenCensus, show example traces.

## Instrumenting with Datadog

Showcase Datadog's deep integration and auto instrumentation, integration with Kubernetes.

## Distributed Tracing

Add distributed traces and showcase the business / process benefits.

## Focus on Business Level APM metrics

Start talking about domain problem on running ecommerce shop, and what you'd want to see, begin building dashboards and instrumenting for shop.

## Q&A

Talk about architecture, trace structure, etc.
